# Sentimental-Analysis-Project
A Python script to extract text data from URLs and conduct text analysis using NLTK and BeautifulSoap by automated data processing and then documented results thoroughly. 
All the necessary information is well documented in the "Sentimental_Analysis.ipynb" markdown cell. Read it before running the cells, the cells should be run in top-down order.
Note: Negative and positive word text files must be saved in a MasterDictionary folder to run it.
